Parallel vs Serial Algorithms in Java using Threads

# About

Serial code was supplied "/ParallelAssignment2023" and was tasked to parallelise the code to obtain a shorter run-time while keeping the functionality the same.
I applied two approaches, one with traditional parallelism "/Parallel Traditional" using Java's ForkJoinPool and my own approach using 4 distinct groups of threads "/Parallel MCM_div 4".

# Run

Reccomended to use IntelliJ IDEA to run for Simplicity 

### Parameters:
rows  columns  x-minimun  x-maximum  y-minimum  y-maximum  search-density

e.g.
```
5000 5000 0 1500000 0 1500000 1
```
